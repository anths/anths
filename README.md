As a community, we should be using other alternatives.
I don't host any of my work here.

(It's also weirdly disapointing how centralized the ecosystem around a

[Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org) is a good alternative which,
in addition to not facilitiating ICE's work,
is more flexible in its services and resists excess centralization.
